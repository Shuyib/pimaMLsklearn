    "**Predictive analytics** is the practice of extracting information from existing data sets in order to determine patterns and predict future outcomes and trends.<sup>[1](http://www.webopedia.com/TERM/P/predictive_analytics.html)</sup> <sup>[2](https://gist.github.com/themiwi/5064046/revisions)</sup> It has a variety of applications in healthcare, credit scoring, recommendation systems like online newspapers and understanding shopping trends of customers. <sup>[3](http://www.predictiveanalyticsworld.com/businessapplications.php) </sup> On the other hand, these applications are possible by drawing from statistical techniques such as predictive modeling, machine learning and data mining. <sup>[4](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Predictive_analytics)</sup> The dataset i will be using is the pima indians dataset. Let's proceed to the next section.\n"

    "\n",
    "Pima indians are native americans living in now central and southern Arizona in the United States of America. <sup>[5](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pima_people)</sup> However, this dataset consists of females at least 21 years old of the Pima Indian heritage.<sup>[7](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Pima+Indians+Diabetes) </sup> Initially, it was used to forecast onset of diabetes mellitus *Smith et al. (1988)* using the ADAP learning algorithm.<sup>[8](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2245318/)</sup> Though in my analysis i will attempt to use machine learning algorithms instead of artifical neural networks that were used in the initial study."
