    "**Predictive analytics** is the practice of extracting information from existing data sets in order to determine patterns and predict future outcomes and trends.<sup>[1](http://www.webopedia.com/TERM/P/predictive_analytics.html)</sup> <sup>[2](https://gist.github.com/themiwi/5064046/revisions)</sup> It has a variety of applications in healthcare, credit scoring, recommendation systems like online newspapers and understanding shopping trends of customers. <sup>[3](http://www.predictiveanalyticsworld.com/businessapplications.php) </sup> On the other hand, these applications are possible by drawing from statistical techniques such as predictive modeling, machine learning and data mining. <sup>[4](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Predictive_analytics)</sup> The dataset i will be using is the pima indians dataset. Let's proceed to the next section.\n"
